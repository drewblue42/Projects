## How to use
This application was created in Qt Creator and is not meant to be downloaded as a stand-alone application. <br/>

Upon opening the program, the opening screen should appear with the title, a car, and a start engine button that works as the start button. <br/>
After clicking the start button, you will be presented with the main table of contents with six buttons that take the user to different content pages that have information about car maintenance. <br/>
Within each information screen, a user is able to take a quiz to test your knowledge, the quiz can be submitted and the user is given a score. If the user isn’t satisfied with their score they are able to restart the quiz. <br/>
Once the user completes all of the quizzes to 100%, the user can see the ‘victory’ screen. 

## Changes made since the official due date:

Additional header comments: We’ve added a header-comment to each file which includes our name and repo information, according to our agreed-on style sheet. <br/>
Tire pressure info and quiz: On the due date, the Tire Pressure quiz and Info pages just had placeholder content. Added actual information and quiz questions to these pages. <br/>
Finished the resizing functions: All of the info pages are set in grid layouts that will adapt to the window size. <br/>
Final style, typos and spelling changes: Unifying code style, method documentation. <br/>
When a quiz is completed with all answers correct, the button for that section will turn green, to show it’s been completed. Then, the “Claim Your Certificate” button is activated only after all the quizzes are complete. <br/>
