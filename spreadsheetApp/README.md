# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of taking an expression represented in a string, and breaking the
string expression into individual tokens. Each token is then examined to calculate the input expression. 

v1.0
With the new addition of the Dependency Graph, the program can now check where variables and 
numbers have dependents or dependees before they can be fully calculated. 

v2.0
The spreadsheet can now handle variables with greater flexibility. In general, it is the same as the FormulaEvaluator class
but with more generalized functionality.

v3.0
The spreadsheet can now use dependency graphs and formulas with cells. The created Spreadsheet class is the basic internals 
for the overall inner workings of the Spreadsheet program.
