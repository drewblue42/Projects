# Comments to Evaluators:
I tried to hit all the edge cases. I am confused with a possible edge case explained in class. 
The professor made it sound like we do not need to test for null, due to the nullable change for 
8.0. Other than that I am confident that my code will function as directed.

# Consulted Peers:

List any peers (or other people) in the class (or outside for that matter) that you talked with about the project for more than one minute.
