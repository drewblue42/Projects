# Comments to Evaluators:
Overall I do not think there is much to mention. I believe I tested for all the possible logic errors, and edge cases. 
My only concern with program is the handling of errors. I believe it was completed correctly, but I do not know
how the gradescope tests cases are formed. In regards to using a helper method for the overall calculations, 
I decided that it varied between different algorithms, and only kept the initial calculation as a helper method.
