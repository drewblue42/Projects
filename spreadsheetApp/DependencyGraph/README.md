# Comments to Evaluators:
This program was definitely a learning experience. I was a little rusty on how to use dictionary
and HashSets together, but the Microsoft learning pages and ChatGPT helped answer 
questions that I was confused about. I even implemented some lambda expression which
are a new territory for me.
