# Comments to Evaluators:
I hit as much code coverage as was possible. I was not able to test the last little part due to the protected class. I 
put nulls in my code, just to cover all my bases. 

# Consulted Peers:

List any peers (or other people) in the class (or outside for that matter) that you talked with about the project for more than one minute.
