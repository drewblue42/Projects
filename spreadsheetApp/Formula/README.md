# Comments to Evaluators:
This was one of the more difficult assignments for me this semester. I ran into a few snags with my testing, and after 
a couple of hours of debugging, it ended up being because I did not put my normalized tokens back into the
normalized tokens list I created. It was a brutal lesson learned. I believe everything is accounted for from the instructions.
